# COS30043 labs/homeworks

This repository is for holding source code with proper context to run them in Swinburne course COS30043

## Frameworks

This repository uses symbolic links to link framework files to the appropriate folders, providing proper context for the relevant source code while eliminating the need to modify them. If there are any problems with the source code not able to locate the proper framework files, please copy the `framework` directory to the same directory as the source code file, e.g:
```
cp framework week2/2.1P/
```
